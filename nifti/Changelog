pynifti (0.20070905.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Fixed a bug in the qform/quaternion handling that caused changes to the
    qform to vanish when saving to file.

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Added more unit tests.
  * 'dim' vector in the NIfTI header is now guaranteed to only contain
    non-zero elements. This caused problems with some applications.

pynifti (0.20070803.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Does not depend on SciPy anymore.
  * Initial steps towards a unittest suite.
  * pynifti_pst can now print the peristimulus signal matrix for a single
    voxel (onsets x time) for easier processing of this information in
    external applications.
  * utils.getPeristimulusTimeseries() can now be used to compute mean and
    variance of the signal (among others).
  * debian/{copyright|watch} now point to the new home of pynifti in the
    niftilib project on SourceForge.
  * pynifti_pst is able to compute more than just the mean peristimulus
    timeseries (e.g. variance and standard deviation).
  * Relaxed build-dependency on libniftiio to any SO-version of the library.
  * Set default image description when saving a file if none is present.
  * Improved documentation.

pynifti (0.20070425.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved documentation. Added note about the special usage of the header
    property. Also added notes about the relevant properties in the docstring
    of the corresponding accessor methods.
  * Added property and accessor methods to access/modify the repetition time
    of timeseries (dt).
  * Added functions to manipulate the pixdim values.
  * Added utils.py with some utility functions.
  * Added functions/property to determine the bounding box of an image.
  * Fixed a bug that caused a corrupted sform matrix when converting a NumPy
    array and a header dictionary into a NIfTI image.
  * Added script to compute peristimulus timeseries (pynifti_pst).
  * Package now depends on python-scipy.

pynifti (0.20070315.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Removed functionality for "NiftiImage.save() raises an IOError
    exception when writing the image file fails."

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Added ability to force a filetype when setting the filename or saving 
    a file.
  * Reverse the order of the 'header' and 'load' argument in the NiftiImage
    constructor. 'header' is now first as it seems to be used more often.
  * Improved the source code documentation.
  * Added getScaledData() method to NiftiImage that returns a copy of the data
    array that is scaled with the slope and intercept stored in the NIfTI
    header.

pynifti (0.20070301.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed wrong link to the source tarball in README.html.

pynifti (0.20070301.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Updated build-depends to comply to the latest Python policy.
  * Initial upload to the Debian archive. (Closes: #413049)
  * NiftiImage.save() raises an IOError exception when writing the image file
    fails.

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Added extent, volextent, and timepoints properties to NiftiImage
    class.

pynifti (0.20070220.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NiftiFile class is renamed to NiftiImage.
  * SWIG-wrapped libniftiio functions are no available in the nifticlib
    module.
  * Fixed broken NiftiImage from Numpy array constructor.
  * Added initial documentation in README.html.
  * Fulfilled a number of Yarik's wishes ;)

pynifti (0.20070214.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Does not depend on libfslio anymore.
  * Up to seven-dimensional dataset are supported (as much as NIfTI can do).
  * The complete NIfTI header dataset is modifiable.
  * Most image properties are accessable via class attributes and accessor
    methods.
  * Improved documentation (but still a long way to go).
