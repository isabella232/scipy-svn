SciPy 0.7.1 Release Notes
=========================

.. contents::

SciPy 0.7.1 is a bug-fix release with no new features compared to 0.7.0.

scipy.io
========

scipy.signal
============

Memory leak in lfilter have been fixed, as well as support for array object

scipy.sparse
============

scipy.special
=============

Several bugs of varying severity were fixed in the special functions:

- #503, #640: iv: problems at large arguments fixed by new implementation
- #623: jv: fix errors at large arguments
- #679: struve: fix wrong output for v < 0
- #803: pbdv produces invalid output
- #804: lqmn: fix crashes on some input
- #823: betainc: fix documentation
- #834: exp1 strange behavior near negative integer values
- #852: jn_zeros: more accurate results for large s, also in jnp/yn/ynp_zeros
- #853: jv, yv, iv: invalid results for non-integer v < 0, complex x
- #854: jv, yv, iv, kv: return nan more consistently when out-of-domain
- #927: ellipj: fix segfault on Windows
- ive, jve, yve, kv, kve: with real-valued input, return nan for out-of-domain
  instead of returning only the real part of the result.

Also, when ``scipy.special.errprint(1)`` has been enabled, warning
messages are now issued as Python warnings instead of printing them to
stderr.


Windows binaries for python 2.6
===============================

python 2.6 binaries for windows are now included. All 0.7.1 binaries requires
numpy 1.3.0 or above.

Universal build for scipy
=========================

Mac OS X binary installer is now a universal build. It requires numpy 1.3.0 or
above.
